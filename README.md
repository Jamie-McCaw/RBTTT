Second Task for 8th Light Apprenticeship Ruby Tic Tac Toe with Test Driven Development. 

After completion of initial TDD TTT was given the task of making the Tic Tac Toe a 4x4 board as opposed to the initial 3x3, this required introducing alpha beta pruning into Negamax to bring the performance to a reasonable point. 

After completion of that task I was given the task of using the 8th Light Limelight GUI Framework to make a GUI Tic Tac Toe game. But only for the 3x3 not the 4x4. 

I also started working on a rails front end for the TTT.
